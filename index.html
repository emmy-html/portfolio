              <hr>
              <p>This project was focused on building a responsive WordPress theme for a marketing company. I loved the process of taking their pre-existing blog, including all of its content and media, and turning it into a WordPress theme. This project features lots of customization features that allow the client to update the website as needed by utilizing plugins and custom post types.</p>

              <h2>Unplugged Retreat</h2>
              <h3>HTML5, CSS3, Git</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>For this project, I was faced with the task of creating a 3 page website for a retreat for tech teams in need of a team building break. It gave me a deeper understanding of how to link multiple pages to one website, as well as having CSS that can easily be reused and/or lightly modified among different website pages. I enjoyed working with flexbox features to create responsive layouts during this project.</p>

              <h2>LOLCAT Clock</h2>
              <h3>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>The LOLCAT Clock Project gave me a variety of tasks to translate into JavaScript. I had to create a clock that displayed the time, while also displaying a different message and image depending on the time of day. By breaking these needs down into pseudocode, I was able to write the appropriate JavaScript functions to bring it all together; then finally connect it to the HTML and CSS that was provided to me.</p>
